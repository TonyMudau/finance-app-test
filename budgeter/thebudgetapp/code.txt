- IDEA:
    Create a dashboard for income and expenditure and what you would like to
    save for. 
                                                              
 
- Algorithm for buying <br>                                                            
- When creating the algorithm which makes buying recommendations based on your finances,
  what is the core theory which covers all cases? 
  <br>
  Lets think about it. Buying cloths in particular. An elderly person and a young person, 
  a women and a man may approach 
  the decsion differently. A man is likey to buy an item from need of ocassion
  and a women might buy it to match another item. A young person might buy it as a trend 
  and an might buy it because its a remake of an old classic.  
  <br>
  How do we make a decsion for all of these individuals? What is important?
  In reality, when it comes to finance, this nothing about sentiments matter. Financial descipline 
  requires no age, gender nor feelings. Sure, we expect men and women to have diffrent needs and therefore 
  differing senses of urgency when it comes to certain items but then again, the bank balance has no regard for this. 
  At the core of any financial decsion is <b>WHAT PERCENTAGE OF MY INCOME
  IS THIS EXPENDITURE</b> and <b>SHOULD I COVER IT USING SAVINGS OR CAN I PURCHASE IT IMMEDIATLY AND HOW
  WILL THAT IMACT ON MY SAVINGS?</b>
  <br>
  These questions have noting to do with gender or how one feels ultimately but rather 
  just the economics. This is somewhat good and brings in discipline as numbers will never 
  lead us astray. After all, if you can manage to keep clothing as 15% of your income, then 
  surely clothing will never make you broke. 
  But this is what simply what we plan to achieve. There is still a human element to it. That
  might be the best Jacket you have ever seen which is costing you 15% of your income AND you 
  might never see it again. What will the algorithm recommend??
